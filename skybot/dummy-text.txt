So, we are going to be using dummy-text.txt in our 
examples from now on. I will assume you have 
downloaded it, and put it in your current working 
directory with your other files, and called     
it dummy-text.txt.

I will then assume that you have at some point opened the file in Python, and read the file contents 
into a variable that we can use later, 
called dummy_text. I will also make the assumption 
you have a basic bot working. If you are still new to 
this, then here is a little framework to get you started. 
I am not going to teach how to use Discord.py’s rewrite here, so this is all you are going to get on it:

Factories

First steps

We are going to introduce the factory classes first. These are your quick, dirty, simple-looking classes that usually do everything you want if you are in a rush. I will assume you know Python, and how to use Discord.py rewrite. If the following example scares you, I urge you learn to walk before you can run. It will save both of us the frustration. Trust me.

So lets first try sending the text in the simplest way possible, remembering we are now working in a command coroutine function (an async def with the @commanddecorator applied to it):
